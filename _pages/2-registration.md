The fee includes course material, coffee breaks and lunch. It does not include travel, dinner or accommodation.

## Scholarships

Two types of scholarships are available for students currently enrolled as regular students of the University of Antwerp. 

- Refund of €150/student after attending a summer or winter school organized at Antwerp Summer and Winter University. Students should prefinance the full tuition fee and can claim a reimbursement of the allowance after submitting a certificate of attendance and proof of payment to the Antwerp Summer and Winter University Office. The following students qualify for this refund: University of Antwerp students regularly enrolled under a diploma contract in a Bachelor, Master, Advanced Master, Preparatory Programme, Bridging Programme, or Academic Teaching Programme in either academic year 2023-2024 or 2024-2025.
- Scholarship for a short international experience for students who qualify for financial aid by the Department of Social, Cultural, and Student Affairs (SCS).

## Registration

We accept applications until 30 June 2024 (unless maximum capacity has been reached). Non-EU citizens advised to apply before 15 May 2024 because the visa application can take up to 3 months.

All applications are submitted and processed through the enrolment platform Mobility Online. The academic committee and the program coordinators evaluate them. Decisions will be made on a rolling basis.

If your application is accepted, you will receive further practical information on payment and visa.  Note that your registration is only complete when the tuition fee is received in the university's bank account.​

Accepted participants will be registered as regular students of the University of Antwerp and will hence receive a student account which gives them access to the catering facilities and to the Wi-Fi network of the University of Antwerp. Furthermore, accepted participants will be automatically insured under the University of Antwerp's policy.
